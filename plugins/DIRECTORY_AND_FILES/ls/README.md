# ls (list)

## Description

This plugin defines useful aliases and functions to display the contents of a directory with coloring.

## Options

If [vivid](https://github.com/sharkdp/vivid) is installed, it is used to change the `LS_COLORS` environmental variable based on the [solarized color scheme](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solarized_(color_scheme)) (also influencing the zsh completion system).

If vivid isn't installed, uses the `dircolor` file ([see](https://github.com/trapd00r/LS_COLORS)) in the current directory to specify the `LS_COLORS` environmental variable.

## Aliases

The following aliases are defined:
