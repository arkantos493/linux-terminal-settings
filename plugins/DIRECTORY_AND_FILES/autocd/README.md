# Expansion of multiple dots

## Description

This plugin provides a way to complete directories on an empty command line for better `autocd`.

## Options

Enables `autocd` and provides directory completion when typing TAB on an empty command line.

If only `./` is present on the command line then only complete executable files.

If nothing of the above is the case: use default completion mechanisms.
